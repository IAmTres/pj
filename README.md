## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Navigate through the landing page and login portals

## Development

This is a static frontend implementation. To extend this into a full application, you would need to:

1. Implement backend authentication
2. Create user and therapist dashboards
3. Add journal entry functionality
4. Implement therapist prompt system
5. Add secure data storage

## Security Considerations

When implementing the backend:
- Use secure authentication methods
- Encrypt all journal entries
- Implement proper access controls
- Follow HIPAA compliance guidelines
- Regular security audits
